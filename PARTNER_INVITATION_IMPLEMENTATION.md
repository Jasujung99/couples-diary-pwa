## Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
"WHEN a user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL prompt them to invite their partner"
- Implemented in PartnerInvitationFlow component
- Automatically shows invitation prompt for users without partners

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
"WHEN a user enters their partner's contact information THEN the system SHALL send an invitation via email or SMS"
- Email invitation implemented via /api/auth/invite endpoint
- Invitation token generated and stored in database
- Ready for email/SMS integration (marked as TODO)

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
"WHEN a partner accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL create a coupled diary space for both users"
- Partner acceptance implemented via /api/auth/accept-invitation
- Database transaction connects both users
- Sets relationshipStartDate for both partners

### Requirement 2.4 ✅
"IF a user already has a partner connection THEN the system SHALL direct them to their existing diary"
- Validation prevents multiple partnerships
- UI shows partner connection status
- Redirects to main app when partner exists

### Requirement 2.5 ✅
"WHEN both partners are connected THEN the system SHALL synchronize their diary entries and shared content"
- Database schema supports couple-based content (coupleId fields)
- Partner relationship established in User model
- Foundation for real-time synchronization ready
